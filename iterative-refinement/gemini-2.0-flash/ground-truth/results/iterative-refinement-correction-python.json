  "99": "def closest_integer(value):\n    value = float(value)\n    t = value % 1\n    if t < 0.5 and t > -0.5:\n        value -= t\n    else:\n        value += (1 - t) if t >= 0 else (-1 - t)\n    return value\n```\n\n**Explanation of Errors and Corrections:**\n\n* **Error 1 (First Attempt):** The original JavaScript code *adds* `t` in the `else` block, but the Python code attempts to do `value += 1 - t if t > 0 else -1 - t`.  The logic here aims to round up if `t` is positive and greater than or equal to 0.5, and round down if `t` is negative and less than or equal to -0.5. However, it rounds the value to an integer by using `int(value)` at the end, therefore the correct return value is not given.\n\n* **Error 2 (Second Attempt):** The core logic of rounding up or down remains flawed.  The condition `t > 0` in `value += (1 - t) if t > 0 else (-1 - t)` is not correct for negative values of `t`. Specifically, when `t` is exactly 0, the code incorrectly enters the `else` block, where `(-1 - t)` evaluates to -1, causing the function to incorrectly subtract 1 from `value`.\n\n* **Correction:** The condition `t > 0` needs to be changed to `t >= 0` to ensure that when `t` is exactly 0, the code does not enter the `else` block. Also, the incorrect `int(value)` was removed to ensure the correct return value.\n\nThe corrected code accurately mirrors the JavaScript's rounding behavior:\n\n1.  It converts the input `value` to a float.\n2.  It calculates the fractional part `t` using the modulo operator (`%`).\n3.  If `t` is between -0.5 and 0.5 (exclusive), it subtracts `t` from `value`, effectively rounding towards zero.\n4.  Otherwise, it rounds away from zero:\n    *   If `t` is positive or zero, it adds `1 - t` to `value`.",

There were no actual errors in the translation. Both attempts were identical and accurately reflected the JavaScript logic in Python. The confusion might arise from the unusual rounding behavior and the binary conversion, but these were accurately implemented.\n\n*   **`if n > m: return -1`**:  This correctly handles the initial condition.\n*   **`k = (n + m) / 2`**: Calculates the average.\n*   **`if k % 1 != 0:`**: Checks if `k` is not an integer (i.e., has a fractional part).\n*   **`k = (n + m + 1) / 2`**: If `k` is not an integer, this line effectively rounds it *up*.  This is a slightly peculiar way to round, but it is exactly what the JavaScript code does.\n*   **`return '0b' + bin(int(k))[2:]`**:\n    *   `int(k)`: Converts `k` to an integer (truncating any remaining fractional part), necessary for `bin()`.\n    *   `bin(int(k))`: Converts the integer `k` to its binary representation as a string (e.g., '0b101').\n    *   `[2:]`: Slices the string to remove the \"0b\" prefix that `bin()` adds.\n    *   `'0b' + ...`: Adds the \"0b\" prefix back, as required by the original JavaScript.\n\nTherefore, no changes are needed; the provided Python code is the correct translation.",
